/*
 *  Simple 'hello world' -- with display of core instance info.
 *
 *  This is a simple test case where cores don't interact with each other,
 *  but which uses memory (globals, heap, and stack) for computation so
 *  that it's somewhat sensitive to partition overlap errors in memory maps.
 *  The computation is long enough that there is some opportunity for one
 *  core to clobber another during computation, if such an error is present.
 *  The lack of interaction between cores means we can test running each
 *  core instance stand-alone using xt-run (which should work).
