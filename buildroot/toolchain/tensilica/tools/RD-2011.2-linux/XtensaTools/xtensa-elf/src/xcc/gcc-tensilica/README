/*  Copyright (C) 2007--2009 Tensilica, Inc.  */
This directory contains files from GCC needed while building libraries.
The files here should be kept in sync with the files in Software/xcc/gcc/gcc.

This directory cannot be named "gcc" because if the "gcc" directory exists,
it is assumed to contain the full set of sources for GCC and the build
will break if that assumption is not correct.
