This directory contains files from libiberty needed while building libstdc++.
The files here should be kept in sync with the files in
Software/xcc/gcc/libiberty.

This directory is not named "libiberty" because if the "libiberty"
directory exists, it is assumed to contain the full set of sources for
libiberty.  If it is there, the top-level makefile insists on building
it for both host and target and we don't want it for either.
