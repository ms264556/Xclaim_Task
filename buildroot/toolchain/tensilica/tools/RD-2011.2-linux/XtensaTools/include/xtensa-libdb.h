/*
 * The purpose of this library is to give a debugger writer the ability to
 * find out everything they need to know to debug a target.  This includes
 * the Xtensa simulator, OCD, XMON, RedBoot and other targets.  To do this,
 * the debugger writer needs to know certain information, including a list
 * of register names, and how to instruct the target to return that information
 * if the target does not already know how to return that information.
 *
 * INTERNAL NOTES:
 *
 * The Xtensa libdb library calls upon Xtensa libisa and libxtparams DLLs/libraries.
 * It also calls upon various C library functions, including malloc()/free()
 * for general allocation.  NEVER calls printf, fprintf, or exit.

 *	name		Includes decimal register index suffix, if part of a register file.
 *			Currently, all names are forced to all lowercase (!!).
 *			Guaranteed unique among all registers reported by libdb.
 *
 *	mem_size
 *	mem_align	For register file entries, memory size and alignment are based
 *			on the register file's assigned ctype; otherwise alignment is
 *			four and size is a multiple of four bytes (future releases *may*
 *			optimize to smaller memory sizes where possible, eg. special
 *			registers that take 16 bits or less, etc).
 *
 *	target_number	Register number that a debug agent on a remote target can use.
 *			This is used in the GDB protocol, so all of GDB's debug agents
 *			see this number when references are made to specific registers.
 *			Guaranteed unique among all registers reported by libdb.
 *			This is also used as the register number for ELF (stabs/dwarf/etc)
 *			debug info sections (dwarf not using this yet as of this writing).
 *			See XTENSA_DBREGN_xxx macros in xtensa-libdb-macros.h for details
 *			on the encoding of this number.
 *
 *			HISTORICAL NOTE:  Previous releases (T1050 and earlier) used
 *			separate numbers for target agents and for debug info sections;
 *			target numbers were formatted in 3 specific fields (type in
 *			bits 31..24, TIE regfile ID in bits 23..16, and index in 15..0);
 *			debug numbers were same as today's target_number for a0..a15
 *			and b0..b15, but were 32..35 for m0..m3 and 256-and-up for
 *			TIE regfiles (in the order read in from the libcc DLL).
 *
 *	num_mappings
 *	mapping		These can be used to construct the value of the register
 *			in terms of other registers (e.g. if the REAL_VIEW or CODE_VIEW
 *			flag bit is set)

 * Description:	Initialize the libdb API.
 *		Returns a value ("handle") that must be passed to

 *
 *		INTERNALLY:  enumerates Xtensa processor registers/state, etc.
 *		The handle is opaque to the caller.  Internally it is usually
 *		a pointer to a block of memory used internally by the implementation
 *		of this API, however the structure of this block is highly subject
 *		to change and must never be accessed directly.
 *
 * Parameters:	isa    -- handle to Xtensa ISA as returned by xtensa_isa_init()
 *			  (see xtensa-isa.h); if NULL is passed, calls xtensa_isa_init()
 *			  using information taken from 'params' (the parameter file)
 * 		params -- handle to core parameters as returned by xtensa_getopt()
 *			  or xtensa_params_init() (see xtensa-params.h);
 *			  in the static version of libdb, Xtensa parameters are fixed
 *			  so this parameter is not needed
 *		errno_p -- ignored if NULL; otherwise, *errno_p is set to 0 on
 *			  success, and to an error code on failure (XTENSA_DEBUG_Exxx);
 *			  see also xtensa_debug_errno()
 *		error_msg_p -- ignored if NULL; otherwise, *error_msg_p is set

 * Function:	xtensa_dbreg_get_code
 *
 * Description:	This function produces an instruction sequence that
 *		loads (restores) from memory or stores (writes/saves) to memory
 *		a specified register.
 *
 *		NOTE:  This facility is generally only available for
 *		user-defined (or TIE-defined) register files for which proper
 *		load and store prototypes were provided.  Other mechanisms
 *		exist for other accessible registers (e.g. direct access possibly
 *		in combination with ROTW for address registers, RSR/WSR for
 *		special registers, and RUR/WUR for user registers and state).
 *
 *		The list of Xtensa instructions produced saves and restores
 *		any temporary registers needed (including temporaries needed
 *		to load/store other temporaries, etc; the TIE compiler ensures
 *		there are no cycles in temporary register references among
 *		register file prototypes).
 *
 *		The instruction sequence produced uses a specified address register
 *		(address_register) to locate where in memory to load or store
 *		the specified register (dbreg) as well as any required temporary registers.
 *		The sequence does not modify address register address_register.
 *		Before executing the sequence, address register address_register
 *		must be loaded with the required address, which must normally be
 *		16-byte aligned (or at least be aligned sufficiently for dbreg
 *		and all direct or indirect temporary registers if any).
 *		Contents of register dbreg are loaded from or stored to this
 *		address, and contents of any temporary registers are saved and
 *		restored following dbreg at this address.  The total amount
 *		of read/writable memory that must be available at this address
 *		is returned in *required_temp_space by this function.
 *
 * Parameters:	debug -- handle returned by xtensa_debug_init().
 *
 *		dbreg -- index of register to spill-to or restore-from memory.
 *
 *		address_register -- number of the address register (a0..a15) that contains
 *			the memory address that dbreg will be stored to / loaded from
 *			(this is an integer in the range 0 thru 15, not a register index).
 *			Any temporary registers are saved/restored past dbreg at
 *			this same address.
 *			NOTE:  In practice, this is assumed to be a4 (or lower).
 *
 *		buf_length -- Number of bytes in the opcodes array
 *			(ignored if parameter opcodes == NULL).
 *
 *		opcodes -- Pointer to an array of bytes in which the Xtensa
 *			instructions are returned, or NULL if calling this
 *			function simply to determine how large this array needs to be
 *			(this function returns the required size in bytes).
 *			If opcodes is not NULL, the array it points to is filled
 *			with a sequence of instructions, each of which consists of
 *			a length byte followed by an instruction of that many bytes.
 *			The instruction itself is stored as a sequence of *bytes* as
 *			they appear in the targeted Xtensa processor's memory;
 *			no endianness-dependent swapping required.
 *			For example, for 3 Xtensa instructions of length 3, 2, and 3,
 *			the contents of the array are the following 11 bytes:
 *				3, op1a, op1b, op1c,
 *				2, op2a, op2b,
 *				3, op3a, op3b, op3c
 *			where eg. op1[a..c] are the three bytes for the first
 *			Xtensa instruction.
 *			Separating the instructions this way makes it easier
 *			to execute them in certain contexts, eg. when feeding
 *			the instructions to a target processor over OCD (JTAG).
 *			To execute these instructions directly from memory,
 *			the length bytes must be stripped and the whole sequence
 *			surrounded by appropriate setup and return code.
 *
 *		required_temp_space -- number of bytes that are required to load or store
 *			this register.  This includes space for the register itself,
 *			as well as space for any temporary registers saved if any.
 *			[These bytes must be available at the address pointed to by
 *			the address_register.]
 *
 * Returns:	Number of bytes written to the opcodes array
 *		(or that would be written to the opcodes array, if opcodes == NULL),
 *		or zero (0) on error.
