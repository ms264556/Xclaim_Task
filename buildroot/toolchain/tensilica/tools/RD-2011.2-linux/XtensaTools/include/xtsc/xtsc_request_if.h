/**
 * Interface for non-hardware communication from a memory interface master to a memory
 * interface slave.
 *
 * This interface is for non-hardware communication from a master module (for example,
 * xtsc_core) to a slave module (for example, xtsc_component::xtsc_memory or
 * xtsc_component::xtsc_router).  It also includes the nb_fast_access() method.
 *
 * The nb_peek() and nb_poke() methods are for non-hardware communication from a master
 * module to a slave module.  For example, they are used by a non-intrusive target
 * debugger to read and write memory without the read/write transaction itself
 * disturbing the hardware state of the target processor or the memory controller.  Of
 * course, if the program executing on the target processor depends upon memory data
 * that is over-written by the nb_poke() method, then processor state will change.
 *
 * The nb_fast_access() method is used by TurboXim to find out what methods are
 * available for accessing memories in fast-functional mode.
 *
 * The xtsc_request_if interface expands the xtsc_debug_if by adding the nb_request()
 * method which is used to model hardware communication .
 *
 * @Note The methods of xtsc_debug_if are all non-blocking in the OSCI 
 *       TLM sense.  That is, they must NEVER call wait() either directly or 
 *       indirectly.  The "nb_" method prefix stands for Non-Blocking.

/**
 * Interface for sending requests from a memory interface master to a memory interface
 * slave.
 *
 * This composite interface is for both debug and normal hardware communication from a
 * memory interface master module to a memory interface slave module.
 *
 * A memory interface master is a module (such as xtsc_core) that is capable of making
 * memory interface requests (for example, read, write, block read, etc.) and a memory
 * interface slave is a module (such as xtsc_component::xtsc_memory) that is capable of
 * servicing memory interface requests.
 *
 * Every memory interface master must have two ports.  These two ports are referred to
 * thoughtout the XTSC documentation as a "memory interface master port pair" or
 * simply a "master port pair".  They are:
 *  \verbatim
    1. sc_port  <xtsc_request_if> (for sending requests)
    2. sc_export<xtsc_respond_if> (for receiving responses)
    \endverbatim
 *
 * Correspondingly, every memory interface slave must have two ports.  These two ports
 * are referred to thoughtout the XTSC documentation as a "memory interface slave port
 * pair" or simply a "slave port pair".  They are:
 *  \verbatim
    1. sc_export<xtsc_request_if> (for receiving requests)
    2. sc_port  <xtsc_respond_if> (for sending responses)
    \endverbatim
 *
 * To connect a memory interface master with a memory interface slave requires two port
 * binding operations:
 *  \verbatim
    1. The master's sc_port<xtsc_request_if> must be bound to the slave's
       sc_export<xtsc_request_if>
    2. The slave's sc_port<xtsc_respond_if> must be bound to the master's
       sc_export<xtsc_respond_if>
    \endverbatim

 * xtsc_core::How_to_do_memory_port_binding.
 *
 * For protocol and timing information specific to xtsc_core, see
 * xtsc_core::Information_on_memory_interface_protocols.
 *
 * @Note The methods of xtsc_request_if are all non-blocking in the OSCI
