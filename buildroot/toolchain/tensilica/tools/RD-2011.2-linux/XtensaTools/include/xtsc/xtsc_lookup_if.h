 * sc_port<xtsc_lookup_if> used to connect to the TIE lookup implementation which
 * inherits from this interface.
 *
 * @Note The methods of xtsc_lookup_if are all non-blocking in the OSCI TLM sense.
 *       That is, they must NEVER call wait() either directly or indirectly.
 *       The "nb_" method prefix stands for Non-Blocking.
