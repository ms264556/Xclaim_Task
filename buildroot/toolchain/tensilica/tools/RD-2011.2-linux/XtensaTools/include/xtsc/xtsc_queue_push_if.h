/**
 * Interface for connecting between a producer and a queue.
 *
 * This interface along with the xtsc_queue_pop_if is used for one way
 * communication between a producer and a consumer through a queue.
 *
 * A producer has an sc_port<xtsc_queue_push_if>, a consumer has an 
 * sc_port<xtsc_queue_pop_if>, and a queue typically has an 
 * sc_export<xtsc_queue_push_if> and an sc_export<xtsc_queue_pop_if>.
 *
 * Often the producer and the consumer are instances of xtsc_core.
 *
 * @Note The methods of xtsc_queue_push_if are all non-blocking in the OSCI 
 *       TLM sense.  That is, they must NEVER call wait() either directly or 
 *       indirectly.  The "nb_" method prefix stands for Non-Blocking.

   *                            as xtsc_core) use this ticket for non-hardware purposes
   *                            such as logging, profiling, and debugging.  Clients are
