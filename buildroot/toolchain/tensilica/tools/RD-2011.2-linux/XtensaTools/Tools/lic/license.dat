# Placeholder for Xtensa Tools license file
# =========================================
#
# If you use a FLEXlm network license server, or you manage
# your licenses in common directories using environment
# variables to locate them (e.g. LM_LICENSE_FILE), then
# you can ignore this file and paste the Xtensa licenses
# into an appropriate common license file.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------
#
# If you are working on a standalone system and do not
# have any other form of FLEXlm licensing setup, then
# the easiest way to license the Xtensa Tools is to
# copy valid node-locked keys into this file.
# No further setup should be necessary.
#
# To cut keys, login to the Tensilica Processor Generator
# and select Options->Licenses from the Configuration 
# Manager menu.
#
#
# A simple node-locked key looks something like this
# (without the prefix #, of course)
#
# FEATURE XTENSA_EVAL xtensad 4.0 30-Apr-2000 0 454780A5EF33 HOSTID=0070047a977a
#
#
# Blank lines and lines prefixed with # are ignored, so you
# can leave this verbiage intact and append your keys at the 
# end
#
