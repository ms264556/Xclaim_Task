   Name                 Type    Description
   ------------------   ----    --------------------------------------------------------
  
   "address_bit_width"  u32     Width of request address in bits.

   "data_bit_width"     u32     Width of respone data in bits.

   "has_ready"          bool    Specifies whether the lookup device has a ready signal.
                                This corresponds to the rdy keyword in the user's TIE
                                code for the lookup.

   "latency"            u32     The latency is defined by the <use_stage> and
                                <def_stage> values in the user TIE code defining the
                                TIE lookup port according to the following formula:
                                  latency = <use_stage> - <def_stage>
                                If "has_ready" is true, "latency" specfies how many 
                                clock cycles after m_ready (TIE_xxx_Rdy) is asserted
                                that m_data (TIE_xxx_In) is valid.
                                If "has_ready" is false, "latency" specfies how many 
                                clock cycles after m_req (TIE_xxx_Out_Req) is asserted
                                that m_data (TIE_xxx_In) is valid.  "latency" must be
                                greater than 0.
                                Default = 1.

   "pin_level"          bool    If true, pin-level connections are used.
                                Default = false (TLM connections are used).

   "vcd_handle"         void*   Pointer to SystemC VCD object (sc_trace_file *) or 0 if
                                tracing is not desired.  This parameter is ignored if
                                "pin_level" is false.
                                Default = 0 (NULL).

   "script_file"        char*   The file to read the test vector commands from.  Each
                                command occupies one line in the file.  Valid command
                                formats are shown below (the first format shows a lookup
                                transaction command):

                                  <delay> <address> [<timeout>]
                                  <delay> STOP
                                  WAIT  <duration>
                                  SYNC  <time>
                                  NOTE  message
                                  INFO  message
                                
                                1.  Integers can appear in decimal or hexadecimal (using
                                    '0x' prefix) format.
                                2.  <delay> specifies how long to wait before sending
                                    the <address> request to the lookup or stopping 
                                    simulation.  <delay> can be 0 (to mean 1 delta
                                    cycle), or "now" to mean no delta cycle delay, or a
                                    positive integer or floating point number to mean
                                    that many clock periods (see "clock_period").
                                3.  <address> specifies the address to send into the lookup.
                                    The <address> format is as specified by Table 3 of
                                    Section 7.3 "String Literals" of the SystemC LRM.
                                    Some example <address> values are:
                                      0x1234            // Hex
                                      0b01101110        // Binary
                                      0d256             // Decimal
                                      256               // Decimal
                                4.  The <timeout> value is only used if "has_ready" is 
                                    true.  It specifies how long to continue sending
                                    the <address> request to the lookup.  For a TLM-level
                                    connection (e.g. to xtsc_lookup), <timeout>
                                    specifies a non-zero integer number of clock
                                    periods and the lookup request is repeated each
                                    clock period for <timeout> number of clock periods
                                    or until the lookup request is granted.  For a
                                    pin-level connection (e.g. to xtsc_lookup_pin),
                                    <timeout> is multiplied by the device's clock
                                    period (see "clock_period") to determine the
                                    maximum amount of time the m_req signal will be
                                    asserted before being abandoned if it has not yet
                                    been not granted.  For a pin-level connection,
                                    <timeout> can be an integer or a floating point
                                    number.  For either a TLM-level or a pin-level
                                    connection, a negative <timeout> value means to
                                    keep trying the request until it is granted.
                                    Default = -1 (keep requesting until granted).
                                5.  The "<delay> STOP" command causes simulation to stop
                                    via a call to the sc_stop() method after the
                                    specified delay.
                                6.  The "WAIT <duration>" command can be used to cause a 
                                    wait of the specified duration.  <duration> can be 0
                                    (to mean 1 delta cycle) or a positive integer or
                                    floating point number to mean that many clock
                                    periods.
                                7.  The "SYNC <time>" command with <time> less than 1.0
                                    can be used to cause a wait to the clock phase
                                    (relative to posedge clock) specified by <time>.
                                    Posedge clock is as specified by "posedge_offset".
                                    For example, "sync 0.5" will cause the minimum wait
                                    necessary to sync to negedge clock.
                                    The "SYNC <time>" command with <time> greater than
                                    or equal to 1.0 can be used to cause a wait until
                                    the specified absolute simulation time.
                                8.  The NOTE and INFO commands can be used to cause
                                    the entire line to be logged at NOTE_LOG_LEVEL
                                    or INFO_LOG_LEVEL, respectively.
                                9.  Words are case insensitive.
                               10.  Comments, extra whitespace, blank lines, and lines
                                    between "#if 0" and "#endif" are ignored.  
                                    See xtsc_script_file for a complete list of
                                    pseudo-preprocessor commands.

   "clock_period"       u32     This is the length of this device's clock period
                                expressed in terms of the SystemC time resolution
                                (from sc_get_time_resolution()).  A value of 
                                0xFFFFFFFF means to use the XTSC system clock 
                                period (from xtsc_get_system_clock_period()).
                                Default = 0xFFFFFFFF (i.e. use the system clock 
                                period).

   "poll_ready_delay"   u32     This parameter is ignored if "pin_level" is true or if
                                "has_ready" is false.  This parameter specifies how long
                                the driver should delay after calling nb_send_address()
                                before calling nb_is_ready().  It is expressed in units
                                of the SystemC time resolution and the value implied by
                                it must be strickly less than the value implied by the
                                "clock_period" parameter.  A value of 0xFFFFFFFF means
                                to delay for one-half of a clock period.  After the call
                                to nb_is_ready(), there is another delay equal to the
                                clock period minus this delay before repeating the call
                                to nb_is_ready() or continuing with the script file.
                                Default = 0xFFFFFFFF (i.e. one-half a clock period).

   Note:  The "poll_ready_delay" parameter was introduced after (not including) RC-2010.1
          to allow the driver to better model xtsc_core behavior.  To get the behavior of
          RC-2010.1 and earlier, set "poll_ready_delay" to 0.

   "posedge_offset"     u32     This specifies the time at which the first posedge of
                                this device's clock conceptually occurs.  It is
                                expressed in units of the SystemC time resolution and
                                the value implied by it must be strictly less than the
                                value implied by the "clock_period" parameter.  A value
                                of 0xFFFFFFFF means to use the same posedge offset as
                                the system clock (from
                                xtsc_get_system_clock_posedge_offset()).
                                Default = 0xFFFFFFFF.

   "sample_phase"       u32     This parameter applies to pin-level connections only.
                                If "has_ready" is true, this parameter specifies the
                                point in each clock period at which the m_ready signal
                                is sampled.  If "has_ready" is false, this parameter
                                specifies the point in each request clock cycle (i.e.
                                a clock cycle in which m_req is asserted) that the
                                "deassert_delay" timing starts.  This parameter is
                                expressed in terms of the SystemC time resolution (from
                                sc_get_time_resolution()) and must be strictly less
                                than the clock period as specified by the
                                "clock_period" parameter.  A value of 0 means sampling
                                occurs (or "deassert_delay" timing starts) at posedge
                                clock as specfied by "posedge_offset".
                                Default = 0.

   "deassert_delay"     u32     This parameter applies to pin-level connections only.
                                If "has_ready" is true, this parameter specifies how
                                long after the m_ready signal is sampled and found to
                                be true, that the m_req signal should be deasserted.
                                If "has_ready" is false, this parameter specifies
                                how long after the "sample_phase" time that the m_req
                                signal should be deasserted.  This parameter is
                                expressed in terms of the SystemC time resolution
                                (from sc_get_time_resolution()) and must be strictly
                                less than the clock period as specified by the
                                "clock_period" parameter.  A value of 0 means the m_req
                                signal will be deasserted 1 delta cycle after the 
                                "sample_phase" time (if m_ready is true or if
                                "has_ready" is false).
                                Default = 0.
