/**
 * This struct is plain old data (POD) used to define a DMA request.
 *
 * The complete DMA is specified by one xtsc_dma_request register set and one or more
 * xtsc_dma_descriptor register sets (as specified by the num_descriptors register).
 * Each entry in this struct defines the value that should be written into its
 * corresponding DMA control register at the DMA registers base address plus the
 * BYTE_OFFSET shown.
 *
 * Write a 32-bit value between 1 and 255 to the num_descriptors register to start the
 * DMA.
 *
 * The DMA control register base address is defined by the xtsc_dma_engine_parms
 * parameter "reg_base_address".
 *
 * @Note The num_descriptors register should be written last because the DMA engine will
 *       start running as soon as the num_descriptors register is written with a non-zero
 *       value.
 * @Note The num_descriptors register should be written using a 32-bit write and the
 *       value written should be between 1 and 255.  The DMA engine detects big or
 *       little endian based on the location in the 32-bit value of the non-zero byte.
 * @Note notify_address8 must be aligned to the PIF bus width.
 * @Note notify_address8 must be physical (not virtual).
 * @Note If desired, target code can wait for turboxim_event_id using the
 *       xt_iss_event_wait() method - see xtsc::xtsc_fire_turboxim_event_id().
 *
 * @see xtsc_dma_descriptor
