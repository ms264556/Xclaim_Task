Library Loader Example README:

To run the overlay_test portion of this example, you need to 
do some preliminary work first. See the chapter on the library loader
in the System Software Users Guide for more information.

Configurations without system memory or where the library call
malloc returns memory that is not executable will not be able to run
the position independent library portions of the example.
